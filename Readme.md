# Lasercut repository

A collection of lasercutting projects. `.dxf` files are meant for lasercutting and were generated from the `.f3d` files with the help of the free plugin [DXF for Laser](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7634902334100976871&os=Win64&appLang=en) for Fusion 360 and [deepnest.io](https://deepnest.io/).
